Hotel Booking Analysis (EDA) in Colab Notebook

This repository contains a single Colab notebook for analyzing a hotel booking dataset. The goal is to gain insights into guest behavior, revenue trends, and identify areas for optimizing hotel performance.

Data
The dataset, hotel_booking.csv, is uploaded and accessed within the Colab notebook. It contains approximately 119,390 rows and 32 columns, including:

Hotel information (name, type, location, etc.)
Booking details (date, arrival, room type, price, etc.)
Guest information (nationality, preferences, etc.)
Additional hotel data (cancellation status, special requests, etc.)
Analysis Workflow
The analysis follows a standard EDA workflow within the Colab notebook:

Data cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory data analysis: Examining data distributions, correlations, and descriptive statistics.
Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to visually represent findings.
Insights and recommendations: Drawing conclusions based on the analysis and suggesting actions for improving hotel performance.
Key Findings (to be updated after analysis)
City hotels might show higher occupancy rates and ADRs compared to Resort hotels.
Specific reasons for cancellation could be identified and addressed.
Potential strategies for attracting guests and boosting revenue might be suggested.
Opportunities for improving guest experience and satisfaction could be highlighted.
